# socket-json-rpc

socket-json-rpc is a Clojure library that simplifies creating async JSON-RPC
servers and clients that communicate using TCP sockets.

**Note:** This is in-development software and _definitely_ shouldn't be used in
production code under any circumstances. I will laugh at you if you get fired
because you used under-developed software and it failed.
